## Example data and Tutorials

---------------

In this directory you will find two example analyses with complete instructions. These include an analysis using a phylogenetic tree with bootstrap support values ([here](https://github.com/dportik/MonoPhylo/tree/master/Example-data/Example-tree-with-bootstrap-support-values)) and an analysis using a phylogenetic tree without support values ([here](https://github.com/dportik/MonoPhylo/tree/master/Example-data/Example-tree-with-bootstrap-support-values)). Navigating to each of these directories will allow you to see the specific commands used to run the analysis. In addition, the complete set of input files and output files for the analysis is provided. These should be useful for helping to run your own analyses with **MonoPhylo**.
